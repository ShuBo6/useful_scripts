# Python Scripts

There are some python scripts that contains spider, image procssing and others under this directory.

These scripts are a practical exercise in my learning.

As time goes by, I will be adding more content.

## Note!

If you want to run this code directly in terminal, you should add the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable with `..`.

BTW, if you want to run this code in vscode, you should create `settings.json` to specify the `PYTHONPATH` environment variables used by the current project.

example:

settings.json

```json
{
    "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/.env",
}
```

.env

```text
PYTHONPATH="python/"
```

The specific configuration is determined by the organization of your project.
