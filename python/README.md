# Python Scripts

There are some python scripts that contains spider, image procssing and others under this directory.

These scripts are a practical exercise in my learning.

As time goes by, I will be adding more content.

## Note

If you want to run this code directly, you should add the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable with `..`.

BTW, because of the configuration of `PYTHOPATH`, the code cannot be run directly in vscode so far.
